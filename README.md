# Performance-Optimization-Memory-Hierarchy
Focuses on how computer memory systems stores data and implementation of the memory systems affects program performance. Measured the performance of computer memory system under different behavior applications. Wrote a "Memory Mountain" program in C/Python that displays a Matplotlib graph creating an array of 8-byte values in memory in order to read the data from the array affecting the cache. The bandwidth is measured by the total number of bytes read from the array which is between the array size and access stride affecting the performance of the CPU.
